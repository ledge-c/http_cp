http_cp is a simple utility to copy files over HTTP.

What this project IS:
---------------------
http_cp is primarily meant to be used inside a LAN/WLAN. The Purpose of this 
project is to enable two nodes on a local network to transfer files between 
them without the need for a USB-stick/Network drive/email etc etc.

What this project is NOT:
-------------------------
* A file server
* An HTTP server
* A secure way of transferring information (note that encryption is not supported. The idea here is to keep it as simple and thin as possible)

How it works:
==============
Suppose we want to copy a file from box A to box B. 
Box A runs http_cp (see example #1) . Box B fires a web browser, fills Box A's address, port and the filename we want to copy in on the address line (Ex. #2).
Box A will then send the file over.

In case box B has asked for a nonexistent filename, or no filename at all for that matter, box B will respond with a list of offered files, 
from which box B can then choose. Once a file (any file) has been successfully copied http_cp will quit. 

How to build:
==============
In the directory where the source is type:

user@box-b> make all

That's it. If everything has gone well you should find the executable "http_cp" 
in the same directory. please see "Usage" for further information on how to use
it.

The target 'debug' is also available, if you want to build with debug symbols.
Please be sure to 'make clean' beforehand, in case object files without 
debugging symbols are already in place.

There is no 'make install' recipe. Just copy the executable 'http_cp' to 
wherever you like.


Examples
==========

Example #1

# Offer the file file_to_send.txt 
user@box-a>./http_cp file_to_send.txt	# Listens on default port 8080

Example #2

# Retrieve the file offered in example #1
# This assumes box-a has the address 192.168.2.3
user@box-b>some_web_browser 'http://192.168.2.3:8080/file_to_send.txt' 

Example #3

# Specify filename with path and send on a different port:
user@box-a>./http_cp -p 8081 /tmp/a/b/file_to_send.txt

Example #4

# Retrieve the file offered in example #3
user@box-b>some_web_browser 'http://192.168.2.3:8081/tmp/a/b/file_to_send.txt'

or, if it's an interactive session just - 

user@box-b>some_web_browser 'http://192.168.2.3:8081' # Wait for the list of offered files to come up, and click on one of the links.
